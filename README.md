# Batcher-Banyan-Network
The Batcher network is built by connecting larger bitonic sorters in order, starting with a 2 * 2  bitonic sorter. As a result, connecting to the input long size n * n bitonic sorter when rearranging the  array correctly is necessary. The following functions are used to programmatically enforce these. sorter_base (): 2 * 2 bitonic sorter sorter (): n * n bitonic sorter batcher (): batcher network. The Banyan network's basic structure is a sorter with two inputs that sorts by focusing on the defined  element of the bit string. When changing which bit to concentrate on and sort, this sorter is linked. It's a Banyan system. The link method is the same as the n * n bitonic sorter, so it can be defined in the same  way recursively. After that, you should decide how much of each stage is of interest to you. These are  mentioned in the following order in the program. The role of is in charge of putting it into action. banyan_base (): 2 * 2 sorter banyan (): banyan network.
